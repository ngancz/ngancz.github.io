Overview
---
I am a doctoral student in psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. My
research examines how early experiences affect the brain-gut-microbiome axis.

Research Interests
---
Childhood and adolescence are important times for the development of the brain-gut-
microbiome axis. The "brain-gut-microbiome axis" is the system that lets the
brain and gut talk to each other and to the microbiome: the microorganisms that
inhabit our body. Normally, the microorganisms that live in and on our bodies
help us to stay healthy, but sometimes, distruptions to the balance of the microbiome
can increase our risk for disease. Understanding how early experiences can affect
our health by changing our brain-gut-microbiome axis will help us to figure out how
dietary changes, prebiotics, probiotics, or even microbiota transplants can help
us to stay healthy.

Research Methods
---
My research relies on a wide variety of methods, including 16S target gene sequencing,
metagenomics, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electrogastrography, functional
neuroimaging, and surveys.

Teaching
---
Pedagogy is a critical aspect of my work. I strive to implement evidence-based
methods in the classroom and to support diversity, equity, and inclusion in the next
generation of scientists. I especially enjoy one-on-one mentoring.
