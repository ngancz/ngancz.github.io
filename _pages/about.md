Overview
---
I am a doctoral student in psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
I research how early experiences affect the brain-gut-microbiome axis.

Research Interests
---
Childhood and adolescence are important times for the development of the brain-gut-
microbiome axis. The "brain-gut-microbiome axis" is the system that lets the
brain and gut talk to each other and to the microbiome: the microorganisms, or germs, that
inhabit our body. Usually, the microorganisms that live in and on our bodies
help us to stay healthy, but sometimes, distruptions to the balance of the microbiome
can increase our risk for disease. Understanding how our bodies, brains, and the friendly
germs that live in and around us all work together will help us to figure out new
ways to help kids grow up happy and healthy.

Research Methods
---
My work implements a wide variety of methods, including 16S target gene sequencing,
metagenomics, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electrogastrography, functional
neuroimaging, and surveys.

Teaching
---
Pedagogy is a critical aspect of my work. I strive to implement evidence-based
methods in the classroom and to support diversity, equity, and inclusion in the next
generation of scientists. I especially enjoy one-on-one mentoring.
