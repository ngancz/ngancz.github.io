title: "Characteristics of the Oral Microbiome in Youth Exposed to Caregiving Adversity
collection: publications
permalink: /talks/characteristics_oralmb.md
excerpt: 'These findings suggest that recent stress may affect the oral microbiome of youth, but that a history of exposure to Caregiving Adversity may alter that relationship. Additionally, several microorganisms were differentially abundant in CA-exposed youth, including depletion of several microorganisms identified in other literature as being responsive to cortisol, as well as increased abundance of potential pathogens. Thus, both recent stress and history of CA are important considerations for researchers and clinicians who work with the oral microbiome.'
