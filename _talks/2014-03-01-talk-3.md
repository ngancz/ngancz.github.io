We found that youth with a history of early adversity (specifically, a history of adoption and/or foster
care) had slightly but significantly different oral microbiomes than did youth with low adversity,
and that the microbiomes of youth with early adversity were less strongly associated with cortisol.
However, the oral microbiome was not significantly associated with mental health in our sample.
